# softwaremill.com v2.5 based on Jekyll

# Quick howtos

## Running in development

### Vagrant virtual machine

As a sort of express lane, you can run a Vagrant virtual machine with the proper ruby version and all the necessary gems installed. To initialize it:

 1. Enter the `vagrant` subdirectory.
 2. Run the `vagrant up` command. *The first execution is going to take a while, as Vagrant needs to download and 
install all the packages, rvm, ruby, gems, etc.*
 3. Enter the virtual machine with `vagrant ssh`.

After that, you'll find a `jekyll-softwaremill` in the home directory, which is the same `jekyll-softwaremill` as the one on your host. So all the changes made on your host in IDEA (or any other editor), are visible also on the virtual machine.

To start working within the virtual machine, on the site itself:

 1. `vagrant ssh` and `cd jekyll-softwaremill` if not there already (ignore the RVM warning).
 2. [Regenerate blogs](README.md#regenerating-twitter-entries-and-blogs).
 3. [Serve the page from Jekyll](README.md#serve-the-page-from-jekyll).

Port 4000 is mapped, so when you serve the page on virtual machine, you can open a browser on your host and see the page on localhost:4000.
    
### Run jekyll on your host (outside of Vagrant)

#### Pre-step 1 - Install Ruby 2.1.2 (where applicable)

if (ruby -v !=2.1.2) continue

1. `curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`
2. `source ~/.profile`
3. `rvm install ruby-2.1.2`
4. In case of `certificate verify failed` navigate to [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download#formats) and get tgz and install rubygems by `ruby setup.rb`

#### Pre-step 2 - Install and apply bundler

1. Ensure Ruby version is as defined in [Gemfile](https://github.com/softwaremill/jekyll-softwaremill/blob/master/Gemfile).
2. `gem install bundler`
3. `bundle`
4. You may need to add `$HOME/.gem/ruby/1.9.1/bin` to `$PATH`.

### Pre-step 3 - Install blog generator dependencies

1. Install PHP for command line. Package name is usually `php-cli`.
2. Go to `__generators/` and call `bundle`.

Most likely you may need imagemagick in `__generators/` for handling images.
1. `brew install ImageMagick`
2. `gem install rmagick -v '2.13.3'`

# Running jekyll

## Regenerating Twitter entries and blogs

Call `__generators/generate.sh`.

Locally most likely you will get, don't freak out.

    [Thu Apr  9 12:58:22 CEST 2015] twitter-blog FAILED
    [Thu Apr  9 12:58:22 CEST 2015] twitter-home FAILED

To solve that locally just create the missing files
 
    touch _includes/generated/twitter-blog.html
    touch _includes/generated/twitter-home.html

## Serve the page from jekyll

Files are regenerated on every change. Note, IntelliJ saves a file after window defocus, so it's usually 2 seconds before you see the change.

1. `bundle exec jekyll serve -w` 
2. Go to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000).

## Sending e-mails via contact form - pre-steps

`__dynamic/contact.json.php` is using built-in `mail()` function in PHP.
It sends the e-mails via `/usr/bin/sendmail`. Server should have some sendmail-alternative installed.
These days, `msmtp` is recommended, and it's installed on critical.sml.cumulushost.eu.

User running the server should create `~/.msmtprc`:

```
defaults
auth on
tls on
tls_trust_file /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/Thawte_Premium_Server_CA.crt

account default
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
from EMAIL
user EMAIL
password PASSWORD
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

During the development you probably want to temporarily change `$to = 'hello@softwaremill.com';` in `__dynamic/contact.json.php`.


## Running in production

Call `bundle exec jekyll build` to generate the website in `_site`.

Call `__proxy/server.sh` to serve `_sites/` at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

### Pre-steps

1. Install Python 2.7.x.
2. `cp __generators/secrets-config.example.php __generators/secrets-config.php` and provide some API keys.

## Auto-rebuild in production

Crontab entry:

    * * * * * /home/softwaremill/jekyll-softwaremill/__generators/cron.sh

Make sure gem directory is in $PATH. Content is regenerated every 20 minutes.

## How to add a static page?

What you see in the project structure is what you get in the browser.
File `/img/agile.png` is visible under address `http://localhost:4000/img/agile.png`.

The only exception is `index.html` - it's visible under `http://localhost:4000/`. Therefore, to add a new page, say `/struts`, you need to create `/struts/index.html` file.

Each file should contain this on top:

    ---
    layout: default
    title: Nice page name - SoftwareMill
    description: A short 140-words SEO-friendly description, goes to meta description.
    keywords: single, word, meta, description, double words
    ---

## How to add a blog post on company blog?

Create a new file in `_posts/company/`. The filename should be `YYYY-MM-DD-permalink-to-the-post.markdown`.
This is what every new post needs to have on top:

    ---
    layout: simple_post
    title: Your blog post title
    description: A short description that will appear as a post excerpt. This will appear in Google as well. Keep it short.
    keywords: list, of, several, most, important, words
    author: Name Surname
    categories:
    - company
    ---

If you don't have an official photo yet, please remove a line with `author_login`.
A placeholder will be rendered instead.

If you remove a post from `company` category, the post will be available via a permalink only.
It won't appear on the blog. May be useful for testing.

If you'd like to add a Table of Contents to the left, add the `include_toc: true` option.

Below the `---` you write a post in Markdown flavor. It's the same as on Github.
See an [example blog post][example-blog] and [Markdown documentation][markdown] for details.

You may use a plain HTML. Change the file extension to `html`.
You may also use Textile or whatever but you have to figure out yourself.

## How to add presentation post?

Create a new file in `_posts/presentations/`. The filename should be `YYYY-MM-DD-permalink-to-the-post.markdown`.
This is what every new post needs to have on top:

    ---
    layout: simple_presentation
    title: Your conference talk topic
    abstract_fragment: Short abstract fragment to be displayed on post thumbnail
    keywords: list, of, several, most, important, words
    speaker: Name Surname
    speaker_login: login
    categories:
    - presentations
    ---

* login should be equal to the filaname of photo of person
* if there's no photo yet, clone `img/members/no-image.png` no-image.png into new file person_login.png and use it as a speaker-Login

If you remove a post from `presentation` category, the post will be available via a permalink only.
It won't appear on the blog. May be useful for testing.

Below the `---` you write a post in Markdown flavor. It's the same as on Github.

You may also use Textile or whatever but you have to figure out yourself.

### Embedding slides

Slides should be embedded using size 427x356, check [example presentation post][example-presentation] for details

__IMPORTANT__: For embed code created by Slideshare you have to replace _http_ with _https_ in code snippet. Standard http won't work on softwaremill.com

For Slideshare you can also remove last text section below slides, something like "from <profileName>" as in most cases only presentation title is enough.

### Embedding video

Video from Youtube should be embedded with 429x241, again check [example presentation post][example-presentation] to see how it should be done.

## Q&A

- Why PHP?
- Twitter feeds collector, e-mail sender and newsletter is Balsam's code. Copy-paste ftw.

- Why Python?
- Python has an embedded HTTP server called SimpleHTTPServer.
  Adding a custom 404 page, url rewriting and threaded dispatching was a matter of a few lines of code.
  We don't need to mess with Apache to achieve such trivial things.

- Why Ruby?
- Jekyll is written in Ruby.

## What can be done better?

1. Replace crappy `__dynamic/contact.json.php` with gem [mail](https://github.com/mikel/mail).
   This will eliminate a need for `sendmail`.
2. Replace crappy Twitter generators written in PHP with gem [twitter](http://sferik.github.io/twitter/).
   This will also eliminate a need for maintaining a config a PHP-based configuration file. Ruby hash would suffice.
2. Upgrade Jekyll to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).
