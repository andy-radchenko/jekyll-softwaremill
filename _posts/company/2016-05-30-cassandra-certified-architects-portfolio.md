[Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org) and [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org) become a central component in an increasing number of SoftwareMill's projects (together with other technologies of course, Scala/Akka/Spark etc. are here to stay!). Some of our team members decided to complete and complement their practical Cassandra knowledge by taking [Datastax’s Academy](https://academy.datastax.com/certifications) courses, and later formalize it "at the source". Hence I am proud to say that we now have three Cassandra Certified Architects: [Jarosław Kijanowski, Michał Matłoka and Andrzej Ludwikowski](https://softwaremill.com/meet-the-team/). Congratulations!

But, that’s not all! We also [added some new projects to our portfolio](https://softwaremill.com/portfolio/). Firstly, a system for ingesting and analyzing energy usage indications; to handle the massive amounts of data, we’ve used Cassandra, Akka (core, streams, http), and for the machine learning component, Spark. Secondly, we’ve recently done some consulting on Kafka; we’ve participated both in the design phase, placing Kafka as a main messaging service, creating proof-of-concept code including performance benchmarks, and finally assisting in operationalizing the setup.
