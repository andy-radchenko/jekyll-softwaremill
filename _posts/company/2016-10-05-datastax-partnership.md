Nowadays some of the hottest services dedicated to backend solutions are provided by Datastax. SoftwareMill delivers complete software projects and provides real-time value from data without worrying about the scale. That's why we use Apache Cassandra, a distributed database offering linear scalability and high availability.

Our clients often ask about tailored solutions to their businesses. They can expect a professional advice from our [certified engineers](https://academy.datastax.com/certifications).  
As a [Datastax Consulting Partner](http://www.datastax.com/partner-directory), we have access to technology news and solutions as one of the firsts. 

If you are interested to know more about Cassandra, take a look at Michał Matłoka's posts about Cassandra  monitoring: [part 1](https://softwaremill.com/cassandra-monitoring-part-1/) and [part 2](https://softwaremill.com/cassandra-monitoring-part-2/).
