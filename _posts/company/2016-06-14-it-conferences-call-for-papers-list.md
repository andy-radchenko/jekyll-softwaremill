In Softwaremill we engage in organizing conferences like [Scalar](http://scalar-conf.com/) and [Confitura](http://confitura.pl/). However a group of our team members also participates in conferences in different role - as speakers. It is very easy to miss Call For Papers and to regret that opportunity to visit some nice place was lost. That is why [we have created a list](https://github.com/softwaremill/it-cfp-list) of IT Call For Papers. It's public and open, so everyone can file a pull request in order to add new CFP to the list. 

Please help us to make speakers life easier!
